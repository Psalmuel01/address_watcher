## Introduction

An "address watcher" app typically refers to a tool or application that monitors and tracks changes or activities related to a specific address. This Dapp is peculiar  and is in sync with Base blockchain to monitor transactions that are coming in and out of a particular address on the base network, in turn a mail will be sent to the owner of the address to notify the user of the activities ongoing on the user‚Äôs wallet. In addition, the address watcher also will tell the type of method called on the address.

## Statement of Problem
In the rapidly evolving landscape of decentralized applications (Dapps) and blockchain technologies, there exists a growing need for a comprehensive solution to monitor and track specific blockchain addresses on Base network. Users engaged in various blockchain transactions, investments, and decentralized activities often encounter challenges in staying informed about the activities associated with specific addresses, hindering their ability to make well-informed decisions and ensuring the security of their assets.
The current absence of a dedicated and user-friendly Address Watcher Dapp creates the following pain points:

### **Lack of Real-Time Monitoring:** 

Existing tools often fail to provide real-time monitoring of blockchain addresses. Users are unable to receive immediate notifications or updates about transactions, token transfers, or other activities related to their watched addresses. This lack of real-time information puts users at a disadvantage, especially in dynamic and fast-paced blockchain environments.
### **Limited Customization and Flexibility:**

 Users face challenges in customizing the parameters for address monitoring according to their specific needs. A one-size-fits-all approach is insufficient, and users require the ability to set personalized alerts and criteria based on transaction amounts, frequency, or other relevant factors. The absence of such customization limits the effectiveness of address monitoring tools.
### Security Concerns: 
Security is a paramount concern in the blockchain space. Users currently lack a robust and user-friendly solution to actively monitor and be alerted about any suspicious or unauthorized activities related to their blockchain addresses. Without such proactive monitoring, users are vulnerable to potential threats and security breaches.
### Fragmented User Experience: 

The existing tools and platforms for address monitoring are often fragmented, requiring users to navigate through multiple interfaces and platforms to get a holistic view of their watched addresses. This fragmented user experience adds complexity and reduces efficiency in managing and monitoring blockchain addresses.

## Significance  of the Project.

Address Watcher Dapp aims to address these challenges by providing a unified, customizable, and real-time monitoring solution for Base blockchain addresses. The development of this Dapp seeks to empower users with the tools and information needed to make informed decisions, enhance security, and streamline the overall experience of monitoring blockchain activities.



## Scope of the Project.

This project will capture the following features:
 1. Users will connect their wallets and register their address to be watched.Then the address watcher can alert the type of transaction running on their wallet i.e inflow and outflow transactions.

2. NFT : NFTthe name, Id and other attributes of the NFT will be alerted in the email that will be transferred in and out of the wallet.
Contract interaction: The functions in the contract will be decoded, transaction hash and other information will be sent along in the mail.

## Benefit to the Base network

The Address Watcher Dapp can bring several significant benefits to the base network and its users, contributing to a more secure, efficient, and user-friendly blockchain ecosystem:

### Enhanced Security: 

By providing real-time monitoring and customizable alerts, the Address Watcher Dapp enhances the overall security of the base network. Users can receive immediate notifications about any suspicious activities or unauthorized transactions related to their addresses, allowing them to take prompt action and mitigate potential risks.
### Improved User Experience:

 The Dapp's unified interface and customizable features simplify the process of monitoring multiple addresses across different networks. This streamlined user experience reduces the complexity associated with tracking blockchain activities, ultimately making it more user-friendly and accessible to a broader audience.
### Increased User Engagement: 

With the ability to set personalized criteria and receive real-time updates, users are more likely to stay actively engaged with the base network. The Address Watcher Dapp encourages users to participate more confidently in decentralized activities, knowing they have a reliable tool to monitor and manage their blockchain addresses effectively.
### Efficient Decision-Making: 

Users can make more informed decisions by staying up-to-date on the activities associated with their addresses. Whether it's monitoring token transfers, transaction amounts, or other relevant parameters, the Dapp provides users with the information needed to make timely and well-informed decisions within the base network.
### Community Trust and Adoption:

 The Address Watcher Dapp contributes to building trust within the blockchain community by addressing security concerns and providing a valuable tool for users. As the Dapp gains popularity, it can attract more users to the base network, fostering a sense of community and contributing to the overall adoption and growth of the network.
### Customization for Diverse Use Cases:

 The customizable features of the Address Watcher Dapp make it adaptable to a wide range of use cases. Users, including investors, developers, and businesses, can tailor the monitoring parameters to suit their specific needs. This flexibility adds value to the base network by accommodating a diverse user base with varied requirements.
### Network Integrity and Compliance:

 The Dapp can contribute to maintaining the integrity of the base network by enabling users to actively monitor and report any suspicious activities. This not only enhances security but also supports compliance measures within the blockchain ecosystem, fostering a more reliable and trustworthy network.

### Premium features:

Users will  need to pay for these features to be able to enjoy it. These features are üëç

1. Breakdown flow of the transactions for weeks, months, yearly.

2. Statement of account can be printed but users will be charged for this service.

3. Checker for infringement into an account before activities are carried out on the wallet.

## Conclusion: 

The Address Watcher Dapp's integration with the base network brings a multitude of benefits, ranging from heightened security and improved user experience to increased community trust and network integrity. This Dapp plays a crucial role in advancing the capabilities and attractiveness of the underlying blockchain network.
